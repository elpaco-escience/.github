## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This project comprises Python and R packages for dealing with interactional data and analysing conversational dynamics. The `scikit-talk` Python package is aimed at loading, processing, transforming and analysing conversational data with methods from bioacoustics, signal processing and natural language processing. The `talkr` R package is designed to support rapid quality control, new ways of visualizing conversational structure, and methods for analysing conversational dynamics. Tools from `scikit-talk` and `talkr` can be used independently but are also designed to work well together.

These resources are being developed within the framework of [Elementary Particles of Conversation](https://markdingemanse.net/elpaco/), with key support from a [grant from the Netherlands eScience Center](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/diversity-aware). Contributors include:
* Mark Dingemanse (PI, Elementary Particles of Conversation)
* Andreas Liesenfeld (postdoc, Elementary Particles of Conversation)
* Barbara Vreede (Research Software Engineer, Netherlands eScience Center)
* Eva Viviani (Research Software Engineer, Netherlands eScience Center)

Both `scikit-talk` and `talkr` are under active development. Use at your own risk.
